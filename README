This is a little Make script whose purpose, generally, is to send
post-commit emails to people, including the full diff, whenever a
remote (e.g., github.com, or anywhere else really) repository is
updated.

Why it exists

I wanted a way to keep people up to date when the Sandstorm wiki gets
updated. The Sandstorm wiki is hosted on github.com, and github.com
doesn't have a way to send change diffs for wikis.

How to configure

Notice the configuration.example file in the repository. Copy that
to git-ignored/configuration, making sure to change the following
variables:

* REMOTE_GIT_REPO_URL (presumably set this to the https:// clone URL
  for the github URL you want to follow)
